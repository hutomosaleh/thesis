## 23.12.22

- GPU calls can be parallelized using streams
- Try CPU Profiler intel vtuned
- The paper focuses on GPU processing schemes, not CPU+GPU
  - It has different novelty but can be used as our baseline too
- Maybe CPU can be parallelized using cudaGraph (unsure)
- Next meeting is on 6. January
